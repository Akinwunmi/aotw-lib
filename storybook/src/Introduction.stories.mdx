# Archive of the World Library

This is a very basic library, based on the Design System that was developed for the Archive of the World.

### The Shadow DOM and dynamic styling

In this library you will find reusable components &mdash; made with _Lit_ &mdash; and an _SCSS_ theme containing variables, colors and typography.
